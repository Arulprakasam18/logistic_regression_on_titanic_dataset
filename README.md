 # Logistic Regression project on Titanic dataset
   - 1. Problem statement :
Problem Statement: The goal is to predict survival of passengers travelling in RMS Titanic using Logistic regression.

  -  2.Data Loading and Description :
     The dataset consists of the information about people boarding the famous RMS Titanic. Various variables present in the dataset includes data of age, sex, fare, ticket etc.
The dataset comprises of 891 observations of 12 columns.

# Importing packages :
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
# Importing Dataset :
Importing training dataset using pd.read_csv

# Preprocessing the data :
Here we are doing simple exploratory data analysis. Dealing with missing values

Dropping / Replacing missing entries of Embarked.
Replacing missing values of Age and Fare with median values.
Dropping the column 'Cabin' as it has too many null values.
Drawing pair plot to know the joint relationship between 'Fare' , 'Age' , 'Pclass' & 'Survived'
enter image description here

Observing the diagonal elements,

More people of Pclass 1 survived than died (First peak of red is higher than blue)

More people of Pclass 3 died than survived (Third peak of blue is higher than red)

More people of age group 20-40 died than survived.

Most of the people paying less fare died.

Establishing coorelation between all the features using heatmap.


Age and Pclass are negatively corelated with Survived.
FamilySize is made from Parch and SibSb only therefore high positive corelation among them.
Fare and FamilySize are positively coorelated with Survived.
With high corelation we face redundancy issues.
# Logistic Regression :
4.1 Introduction to Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a techinque used for solving the classification problem.
And Classification is nothing but a problem of identifing to which of a set of categories a new observation belongs, on the basis of training dataset containing observations (or instances) whose categorical membership is known.
For example to predict:
Whether an email is spam (1) or not (0) or,
**Whether the tumor is malignant (1) or not (0)
**Below is the pictorial representation of a basic logistic regression model to classify set of images into happy or sad.

Both Linear regression and Logistic regression are supervised learning techinques. But for the Regression problem the output is continuous unlike the classification problem where the output is discrete.

Logistic Regression is used when the dependent variable(target) is categorical.

Sigmoid function or logistic function is used as hypothesis function for logistic regression.

 # Preparing X and y using pandas
X = titanic.loc[:,titanic.columns != 'Survived'] y = titanic.Survived

 # Splitting X and y into training and test datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.20, random_state=1)

 # Logistic regression in scikit-learn
To apply any machine learning algorithm on your dataset, basically there are 4 steps:

# Load the algorithm
Instantiate and Fit the model to the training dataset
Prediction on the test set
Calculating the accuracy of the model
The code block given below shows how these steps are carried out:

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression logreg = LogisticRegression() logreg.fit(X_train, y_train) accuracy_score(y_test,y_pred_test))

#  Using the Model for Prediction
y_pred_train = logreg.predict(X_train)

y_pred_test = logreg.predict(X_test)

We need an evaluation metric in order to compare our predictions with the actual values.
Model evaluation :
Error is the deviation of the values predicted by the model with the true values.
We will use accuracy score __ and __confusion matrix for evaluation.

# Model Evaluation using accuracy classification score
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score print('Accuracy score for test data is:', accuracy_score(y_test,y_pred_test))

Accuracy score for test data is: 0.8144692737430168
 # Model Evaluation using confusion matrix
A confusion matrix is a summary of prediction results on a classification problem.

The number of correct and incorrect predictions are summarized with count values and broken down by each class.
Below is a diagram showing a general confusion matrix.

Adjusting Threshold for predicting Died or Survived.

In the section we have used, .predict method for classification. This method takes 0.5 as the default threshold for prediction.

Now, we are going to see the impact of changing threshold on the accuracy of our logistic regression model.
